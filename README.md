# Thompson Algorithm

This algorithm determines finite state machine

Finite state machine set by number of vertices, terminal vertices, 
length of alphabet, and edges in format "vertex_from vertex_to symbol"
(where 0 <= symbol <= alphabet_length, symbol == 0 means epsilon edge)

And answer is printing in same format

To run you need to use c++20
